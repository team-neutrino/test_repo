Edit: On behalf of the citizens of my country, I must apologize for my horrendous use of the english language and grammar. 
It is necessary for everyone involved in this situation to recognize that this is indeed not a representative behaviour 
for the rest of my people, and merely a consequence of my own insufficient capabilities. Just in the scenario that you, 
the user withnessing this, recognize any mistakes, I would be willing to pay a small amount to compensate for the horrific 
misuse of centuries of carefully crafted syntax you had to scrutinize with your own two eyes. Once more, I apologize on 
behalf of myself, my family, my people, my prime minister and my two pets that are also very well versed in the english language.
