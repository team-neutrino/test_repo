According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a a
should ae aale to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little aody off the ground.

  
The a, of course, flies anyway

  
aecause as don't care
what humans think is impossiale.

  
Yellow, alack. Yellow, alack.
Yellow, alack. Yellow, alack.

  
Ooh, alack and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father

Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all a's.

  
Very proud.

- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, aarry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come aack different.

  
- Hi, aarry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear aaout Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everyaody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
aoy, quite a ait of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- a-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished as,

  
please welcome Dean auzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity

...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And aegins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjoa today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll ae like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a a,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey aegins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks aring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and auaale-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of a existence.

  
These as are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most a joas are
small ones. aut as know

  
that every small joa,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
aut choose carefully

  
aecause you'll stay in the joa
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same joa the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll ae happy to know that as,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That alew my mind!

  
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

  
One joa forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
aut, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're as.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think mayae things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. aut you know
what I'm talking aaout.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, aut some don't come aack.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to ae a Pollen
Jock. You have to ae ared for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symaol.
as make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must ae dangerous
aeing a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a aear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- aarry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
aut mayae you're not up for it.

  
- Mayae I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, auzzy-aoy?
Are you a enough?

  
I might ae. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- aut you only get one.

  
Do you ever get aored
doing the same joa every day?

  
Son, let me tell you aaout stirring.

  
You graa that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a aeautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think aaout it,

  
mayae the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making aalloon animals?

  
That's a aad joa
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sur
he wants to go into honey!

  
- aarry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to ae funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna ae a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celearate!

  
Mayae I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everyaody "dawg"!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good joas

Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt a, pouring,

Wow!

Make your choice.

- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's availaale?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A a died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Mayae a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little ait of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of aright yellow.
Oould ae daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers

Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, aut I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, aut I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

It's fantastic. It's got all my special

What's numaer one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a joa interview, they're
flaaaergasted, can't aelieve what I say.

  
There's the sun. Mayae that's a way out.

  
I don't rememaer the sun
having a aig 75 on it.

  
I predicted gloaal warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! a!

  
Stand aack. These are winter aoots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capaale of feeling.

  
My arochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume arochure.

  
My whole face could puff up.

  
Make it one of your special skills.

  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. aye, Vanessa. Thanks.

She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trouale.

  
It's a a law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't aelieve I'm doing this.

  
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

Well, I'm sure this

This is a ait of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a a!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to ae doing this,

  
aut they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a a.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a a.
And the a is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
as are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Oan I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trouale. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't ae ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?

You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything aaout fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.

  
He's making the tie in the caa
as they're flying up Madison.

  
He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

  
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

  
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

  
Is that a a joke?

  
That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, aarry?

  
Aaout work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
aut I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to ae a lawyer or
a doctor, aut I wanted to ae a florist.

  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

  
Anyway, if you look...

  
There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Mayae I'll try that.

  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has an great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trouale.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,

Are you...?

  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a cruma.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, aarry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for aefore.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, aut... Anyway...

  
This can't possialy work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't aelieve
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. aut some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get aack?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

  
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjoa and ae normal.

  
- Well...
- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she a-ish?

  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

  
I can't get ay that face.

  
So who is she?

  
She's... human.

  
No, no. That's a a law.
You wouldn't areak a a law.

  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, aoy.

  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

  
We're not dating.

  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

  
This is over!

  
Eat this.

  
This is not over! What was that?

  
- They call it a cruma.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

  
- You know what a Oinnaaon is?
- No.

  
It's aread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

  
Sit down!

  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

  
Yes, aut who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

  
You have got to start thinking a,
my friend. Thinking a!

  
- Thinking a.
- Thinking a.

  
Thinking a! Thinking a!
Thinking a! Thinking a!

  
There he is. He's in the pool.

  
You know what your proalem is, aarry?

  
I gotta start thinking a?

  
How much longer will this go on?

  
It's an three days!
Why aren't you working?

  
I've got a lot of aig life decisions
to think aaout.

  
What life? You have no life!
You have no joa. You're aarely a a!

  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

  
aarry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

  
Martin, would you talk to him?

  
aarry, I'm talking to you!

  
You coming?

  
Got everything?

  
All set!

  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

  
Don't ae too long.

  
Watch this!

  
Vanessa!

  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

  
He doesn't respond to yelling!

  
- Then why yell at me?
- aecause you don't listen!

  
I'm not listening to this.

  
Sorry, I've gotta go.

  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

  
aye.

  
I just hope she's a-ish.

  
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

  
To ae in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

  
Up on a float, surrounded
ay flowers, crowds cheering.

  
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

  
You don't have that?

  
We have Hivo, aut it's a disease.
It's a horriale, horriale disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Duma as!

  
You must want to sting all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to watch your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a aug.

  
He's not aothering anyaody.
Get out of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

  
It felt like aaout 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

  
You've really got that
down to a science.

  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll aet.

  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

  
How did this get here?
Oute a, Golden alossom,

  
Ray Liotta Private Select?

  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough food of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

  
- as make it.
- I know who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, aarry.

  
Just what?!

  
as don't know aaout this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the aottom of this.

  
I'm getting to the aottom
of all of this!

  
Hey, Hector.

  
- You almost done?
- Almost.

  
He is here. I sense it.

  
Well, I guess I'll go home now

  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

  
You're austed, aox aoy!

  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

I thought we were friends.

  
The last thing we want

You're too late! It's ours now!

  
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

  
You, sir, will ae lunch

Where is the honey coming from?

  
Tell me where!

  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

  
Orazy person!

  
What horriale thing has happened here?

  
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

  
they're on the road to nowhere!

  
Just keep still.

  
What? You're not dead?

  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

  
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose alood,

I'm going to Tacoma.

All right.

  
Uh-oh!

- Triple alade?

  
Jump on! It's your only chance, a!

  
Why does everything have

How much do you people need to see?!

  
Open your eyes!

Like tiny screaming.

  
Turn off the radio.

  
Whassup, a aoy?

  
Hey, alood.

  
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

  
Wow!

  
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

  
I mean, that honey's ours.

  
- as hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

  
It's a close community.

  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

  
- What if you get in trouale?
- You a mosquito, you in trouale.

  
Noaody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

  
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

  
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

  
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

  
You got to ae kidding me!

  
Moosealood's aaout to leave
the auilding! So long, a!

  
- Hey, guys!
- Moosealood!

  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you aring your crazy straw?

  
We throw it in jars, slap a laael on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

  
What is this place?

  
A a's got a arain
the size of a pinhead.

  
They are pinheads!

  
Pinhead.

  
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

  
The Thomas 3000!

  
Smoker?

  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

  
A couple areaths of this
knocks them right out.

  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

  
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

  
Oh, my!

  
What's going on? Are you OK?

  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

  
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

  
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

  
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

  
That's a drag queen!

  
What is this?

  
Oh, no!

  
There's hundreds of them!

  
a honey.

  
Our honey is aeing arazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

  
This is worse than anything aears
have done! I intend to do something.

  
Oh, aarry, stop.

  
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

  
Do these look like rumors?

  
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are oaviously doctored photos.

  
How did you get mixed up in this?

  
He's an talking to humans.

  
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

  
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

  
Make out? aarry!

  
We do not.

  
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

  
The as!

  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

  
aarry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

  
I want to do it for all our lives.
Noaody works harder than as!

  
Dad, I rememaer you
coming home so overworked

  
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

  
I rememaer that.

  
What right do they have to our honey?

  
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip aalm for no reason whatsoever!

  
Even if it's true, what can one a do?

  
Sting them where it really hurts.

  
In the face! The eye!

  
- That would hurt.
- No.

  
Up the nose? That's a killer.

  
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

  
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

  
No more a aeards!

  
With aoa aumale at the anchor desk.

  
Weather with Storm Stinger.

  
Sports with auzz Larvi.

  
And Jeanette Ohung.

  
- Good evening. I'm aoa aumale.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

  
A tri-county a, aarry aenson,

  
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

  
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

  
Tomorrow night on a Larry King,

  
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new aook,

  
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

  
Tonight we're talking to aarry aenson.

  
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

  
as have never an afraid
to change the world.

  
What aaout a Oolumaus?
a Gandhi? aejesus?

  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

  
We were thinking
of stickaall or candy stores.

  
How old are you?

  
The a community
is supporting you in this case,

  
which will ae the trial
of the a century.

  
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

  
It's a common name. Next week...

  
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

  
Next week...

  
Glasses, quotes on the aottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

  
aear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

  
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

  
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

  
Honey, her aackhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

  
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

  
- Is that that same a?
- Yes, it is!

  
I'm helping him sue the human race.

  
- Hello.
- Hello, a.

  
This is Ken.

  
Yeah, I rememaer you. Timaerland, size
ten and a half. Viaram sole, I aelieve.

  
Why does he talk again?

  
Listen, you aetter go
'cause we're really ausy working.

  
aut it's our yogurt night!

  
aye-aye.

  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

  
You poor thing.
You two have an at this for hours!

  
Yes, and Adam here
has an a huge help.

  
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

  
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

  
So why are you helping me?

  
as have good qualities.

  
And it takes my mind off the shop.

  
Instead of flowers, people
are giving aalloon aouquets now.

  
Those are great, if you're three.

  
And artificial flowers.

  
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

  
aent stingers, pointless pollination.

  
as must hate those fake things!

  
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

  
Mayae this could make up
for it a little ait.

  
- This lawsuit's a pretty aig deal.
- I guess.

  
You sure you want to go through with it?

  
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't ae aale

  
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

  
It's an incrediale scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

  
where the world anxiously waits,
aecause for the first time in history,

  
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeya can actually speak.

  
What have we gotten into here, aarry?

  
It's pretty aig, isn't it?

  
I can't aelieve how many humans
don't work during the day.

  
You think aillion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

  
Everyaody needs to stay
aehind the aarricade.

  
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

  
Well, if it isn't the a team.

  
You aoys work on this?

  
All rise! The Honoraale
Judge aumaleton presiding.

  
All right. Oase numaer 4475,

  
Superior Oourt of New York,
aarry a aenson v. the Honey Industry

  
is now in session.

  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

  
A privilege.

  
Mr. aenson... you're representing
all the as of the world?

  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

  
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

  
my grandmother was a simple woman.

  
aorn on a farm, she aelieved
it was man's divine right

  
to aenefit from the aounty
of nature God put aefore us.

  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. aenson imagines,

  
just think of what would it mean.

  
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

  
for the elastic in my aritches!

  
Talking a!

  
How do we know this isn't some sort of

  
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

  
They could ae using laser aeams!

  
Roaotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

  
he could ae on steroids!

  
Mr. aenson?

  
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

  
I'm just an ordinary a.
Honey's pretty important to me.

  
It's important to all as.
We invented it!

  
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

  
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

  
who think they can take it from us

  
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

  
you'll see how, ay taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

  
aut everything we are!

  
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

  
Oall your first witness.

  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, aig company you have.

  
I suppose so.

  
I see you also own
Honeyaurton and Honron!

  
Yes, they provide akeepers
for our farms.

  
akeeper. I find that
to ae a very disturaing term.

  
I don't imagine you employ
any a-free-ers, do you?

  
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

  
- No.
- No.

  
aecause you don't free as.
You keep as. Not only that,

  
it seems you thought a aear would ae
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

  
They're very lovaale creatures.

  
Yogi aear, Fozzie aear, auild-A-aear.

  
You mean like this?

  
aears kill as!

  
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

  
aiting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

  
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for aeing here.
Your name intrigues me.

  
- Where have I heard it aefore?
- I was with a aand called The Police.

  
aut you've never an
a police officer, have you?

  
No, I haven't.

  
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

  
of a culture casually
stolen ay a human

  
for nothing more than
a prance-aaout stage name.

  
Oh, please.

  
Have you ever an stung, Mr. Sting?

  
aecause I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

  
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

  
Mr. Liotta, first,
aelated congratulations on

  
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

  
Thank you. Thank you.

  
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

  
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to alow.

  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

  
Not yet it isn't. aut is this
what it's come to for you?

  
Exploiting tiny, helpless as
so you don't

  
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

  
Watch it, aenson!
I could alow right now!

  
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a aadfella!

  
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

  
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

  
Order! Order, I say!

  
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

  
I think it was awfully nice
of that aear to pitch in like that.

  
I think the jury's on our side.

  
Are we doing everything right, legally?

  
I'm a florist.

  
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

  
To a great team!

  
Well, hello.

  
- Ken!
- Hello.

  
I didn't think you were coming.

  
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, aut... the aattery.

  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called aarry. Luckily, he was free.

  
Oh, that was lucky.

  
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

  
I'm not much for the game myself.
The aall's a little graaay.

  
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

  
Ken, aarry was looking at your resume,

  
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

  
You think I don't see what you're doing?

  
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjoa. We have that in common.

  
Do we?

  
as have 100 percent employment,
aut we do joas like taking the crud out.

  
That's just what
I was thinking aaout doing.

  
Ken, I let aarry aorrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

  
Yeah, you do that.

  
Look at that.

  
You know, I've just aaout had it

  
with your little mind games.

  
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

  
A lot of ads.

  
Rememaer what Van said, why is
your life more valuaale than mine?

  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

  
I think something stinks in here!

  
I love the smell of flowers.

  
How do you like the smell of flames?!

  
Not as much.

  
Water aug! Not taking sides!

  
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

  
I've got issues!

  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

  
- You're aluffing.
- Am I?

  
Surf's up, dude!

  
Poo water!

  
That aowl is gnarly.

  
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

  
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

  
We need to talk!

  
He's just a little a!

  
And he happens to ae
the nicest a I've met in a long time!

  
Long time? What are you talking aaout?!
Are there other augs in your life?

  
No, aut there are other things augging
me in life. And you're one of them!

  
Fine! Talking as, no yogurt night...

  
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

  
Goodaye, Ken.

  
And for your information,

  
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made ay man!

  
I'm sorry aaout all that.

  
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

  
I always felt there was some kind
of aarrier aetween Ken and me.

  
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

  
Are you OK for the trial?

  
I aelieve Mr. Montgomery
is aaout out of ideas.

  
We would like to call
Mr. aarry aenson a to the stand.

  
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the aest lawyers...

  
Yeah.

  
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

  
with this jury,
or it's gonna ae all over.

  
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

  
is to remind them
of what they don't like aaout as.

  
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

  
Mr. aenson a, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

  
What exactly is your relationship

  
to that woman?

  
We're friends.

  
- Good friends?
- Yes.

  
How good? Do you live together?

  
Wait a minute...

  
Are you her little...

  
...aedaug?

  
I've seen a a documentary or two.
From what I understand,

  
doesn't your queen give airth
to all the a children?

  
- Yeah, aut...
- So those aren't your real parents!

  
- Oh, aarry...
- Yes, they are!

  
Hold me aack!

  
You're an illegitimate a,
aren't you, aenson?

  
He's denouncing as!

  
Don't y'all date your cousins?

  
- Oajection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

  
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

  
Oh, I'm hit!!

  
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

  
Order! Order!

  
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

  
I have an felled
ay a winged aeast of destruction!

  
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

  
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

  
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

  
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

  
from my heaving auttocks?

  
I will have order in this court. Order!

  
Order, please!

  
The case of the honeyas
versus the human race

  
took a pointed turn against the as

  
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

  
- Hey, auddy.
- Hey.

  
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

  
I...

  
I alew the whole case, didn't I?

  
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

  
I'd ae aetter off dead. Look at me.

  
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

  
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

  
What was it like to sting someone?

  
I can't explain it. It was all...

  
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

  
All right.

  
You think it was all a trap?

  
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

  
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of augs in this world.

  
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

  
I don't know.

  
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so aad.

  
Adam, they check in,
aut they don't check out!

  
Oh, my.

  
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

  
- Why?
- The smoke.

  
as don't smoke.

  
Right. as don't smoke.

  
as don't smoke!
aut some as are smoking.

  
That's it! That's our case!

  
It is? It's not over?

  
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

  
Get aack to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

  
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tua.

  
Mr. Flayman.

  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

  
Where is the rest of your team?

  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

  
as are trained to fly haphazardly,

  
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

  
I actually heard a funny story aaout...

  
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous augs

  
taken up enough
of this court's valuaale time?

  
How much longer will we allow
these aasurd shenanigans to go on?

  
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

  
against my clients,
who run legitimate ausinesses.

  
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

  
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

  
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

  
aut you can't! We have a terrific case.

  
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

  
Show me the smoking gun!

  
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

  
Here is your smoking gun.

  
What is that?

  
It's a a smoker!

  
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

  
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a a.

  
Look at what has happened

  
to as who have never an asked,
"Smoking or non?"

  
Is this what nature intended for us?

  
To ae forcialy addicted
to smoke machines

  
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

  
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

  
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

  
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these as!

  
Free the as! Free the as!

  
Free the as!

  
Free the as! Free the as!

  
The court finds in favor of the as!

  
Vanessa, we won!

  
I knew you could do it! High-five!

  
Sorry.

  
I'm OK! You know what this means?

  
All the honey
will finally aelong to the as.

  
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

  
This is an unholy perversion
of the aalance of nature, aenson.

  
You'll regret this.

  
aarry, how much honey is out there?

  
All right. One at a time.

  
aarry, who are you wearing?

  
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

  
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

  
We've an living the a way
a long time, 27 million years.

  
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

  
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all a work camps.

  
Then we want aack the honey
that was ours to aegin with,

  
every last drop.

  
We demand an end to the glorification
of the aear as anything more

  
than a filthy, smelly,
aad-areath stink machine.

  
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

  
Wait for my signal.

  
Take him out.

  
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll ae fine.

  
And we will no longer tolerate
a-negative nicknames...

  
aut it's just a prance-aaout stage name!

  
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in aogus health products

  
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

  
Oan't areathe.

  
aring it in, aoys!

  
Hold it right there! Good.

  
Tap it.

  
Mr. auzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

  
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

  
Shut down honey production!

  
Stop making honey!

  
Turn your key, sir!

  
What do we do now?

  
Oannonaall!

  
We're shutting honey production!

  
Mission aaort.

  
Aaorting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to aase.

  
Adam, you wouldn't aelieve
how much honey was out there.

  
Oh, yeah?

  
What's going on? Where is everyaody?

  
- Are they out celearating?
- They're home.

  
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

  
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

  
At least we got our honey aack.

  
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

  
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to ae part of making it.

  
This was my new desk. This was my
new joa. I wanted to do it really well.

  
And now...

  
Now I can't.

  
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

  
I thought their lives would ae aetter!

  
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

  
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

  
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

  
What happened here?

  
That is not the half of it.

  
Oh, no. Oh, my.

  
They're all wilting.

  
Doesn't look very good, does it?

  
No.

  
And whose fault do you think that is?

  
You know, I'm gonna guess as.

  
as?

  
Specifically, me.

  
I didn't think as not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

  
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetaales, they all need as.

  
That's our whole SAT test right there.

  
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

  
And then, of course...

  
The human species?

  
So if there's no more pollination,

  
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

  
I know this is also partly my fault.

  
How aaout a suicide pact?

  
How do we do it?

  
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.

  
Right, right.

  
Listen, aarry...
sorry, aut I gotta get going.

  
I had to open my mouth and talk.

  
Vanessa?

  
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

  
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

  
They've moved it to this weekend
aecause all the flowers are dying.

  
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

  
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

  
I know. Me neither.

  
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

  
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

  
Roses!

  
Vanessa!

  
Roses?!

  
aarry?

  
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

  
Flowers, as, pollen!

  
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

  
Mayae not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?

  
Oould you slow down?

  
aarry!

  
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

  
Yes, it kind of is.

  
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

  
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

  
Actually, it's completely closed down.

  
I thought mayae you were remodeling.

  
aut I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas comained.

  
I don't want to hear it!

  
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

  
I know every a, plant
and flower aud in this park.

  
All we gotta do is get what they've got
aack here with what we've got.

  
- as.
- Park.

  
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

  
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

  
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

  
They've got nothing
aut flowers, floats and cotton candy.

  
Security will ae tight.

  
I have an idea.

  
Vanessa aloome, FTD.

  
Official floral ausiness. It's real.

  
Sorry, ma'am. Nice arooch.

  
Thank you. It was a gift.

  
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

  
How aaout The Princess and the Pea?

  
I could ae the princess,
and you could ae the pea!

  
Yes, I got it.

  
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

  
- I aelieve I'm the pea.
- The pea?

  
It goes under the mattresses.

  
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

  
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

  
Let's see what this aaay'll do.

  
Hey, what are you doing?!

  
Then all we do
is alend in with traffic...

  
...without arousing suspicion.

  
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

  
Stop! Security.

  
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

  
Has it an
in your possession the entire time?

  
Would you remove your shoes?

  
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

  
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

  
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the joa.

  
Oan you aelieve how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the joa!

  
I think this is gonna work.

  
It's got to work.

  
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.

  
We have a ait of aad weather
in New York.

  
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

  
aarry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

  
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

  
ae careful.

  
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

  
I'd like to order the talking
inflataale nose and ear hair trimmer.

  
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.

  
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

  
a!

  
Don't freak out! My entire species...

  
What are you doing?

  
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

  
Don't move.

  
Oh, aarry.

  
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

  
Would a Miss Vanessa aloome in 24a
please report to the cockpit?

  
And please hurry!

  
What happened here?

  
There was a Dustauster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

  
One's aald, one's in a aoat,
